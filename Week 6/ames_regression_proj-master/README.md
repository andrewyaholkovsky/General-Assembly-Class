## Business Case

You work for a real estate company interested in using data science to determine the best properties to buy and re-sell. Train a model on pre-2010 data and evaluate its performance on the 2010 houses.

This project uses the [Ames housing data recently made available on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

## Directions

Though the housing data for this project is very rich, it is not trivial to clean and prepare for modeling. Good EDA, cleaning/imputation, and feature engineering will be critical to the success of your models. The computer can't be the researcher for you!

1. You work for a real estate company interested in using data science to determine the best properties to buy and re-sell. Perform any cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA you deem necessary to train a model and evaluate its ability to predict sale price on the test houses.
    * Remove any houses that are not residential from the dataset.
    * Evaluate your predictions with root mean squared error.
