## deidentifying_clinical_notes_with_python

### In this group project, you're going to get a dataset where the Protected Health Infromation (PHI) elements are labeled. The goal is to write python logic that allows you to capture the maximum number of PHI elements in the note while minimizing the number of non-PHI elements. You can see how your solution then generalizes to a second note. I hope this exercise is useful for:
* exposing you to a data science use case
* challenging you to think about how to approach multi step programming problems
* expanding your ability in python via loops, functions, string and list methods, etc.
* getting you to think about how to evaluate success
